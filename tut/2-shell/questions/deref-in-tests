Any tests that attempt to read from a StackVec by directly indexing it
would fail if the Deref implementation did not exist. A couple examples of
such tests are index_oob, index_oob_after_truncate, and indexing. Anything
that mutates elements at indices of a StackVec, on the other hand,
would fail to compile with a missing DerefMut implementation. The only
test that does this is mut_indexing.
