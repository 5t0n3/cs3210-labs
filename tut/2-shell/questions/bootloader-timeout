The transmitter might stall indefinitely if it starts a transmission after
the bootloader sends the initial NAK byte over UART, since the receiver
would be waiting for the first packet's metadata and the transmitter
would be waiting for the initial NAK from the receiver. A timeout
mitigates this by resending the first NAK byte every so often, ensuring
it's seen by the transmitter until a successful transfer occurs.
