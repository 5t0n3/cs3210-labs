A user could attempt to write to a read-only (input) pin or read from
a write-only (output) pin which would not have the desired effects. By
guaranteeing valid states at a type level (and not allowing users to
forge them), both we and users can be sure that their operations will
succeed and have the desired effects (barring other failures).
