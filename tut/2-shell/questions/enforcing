The inner() method of the Readable and Writeable traits return a *const T
and a *mut T, respectively; *const T pointers are technically immutable,
but can be cast to *mut T pointers which are mutable. Rather,
readability/writability is enforced by only exposing methods corresponding
to the allowed operation (write() for Writeable and read() for Readable).
