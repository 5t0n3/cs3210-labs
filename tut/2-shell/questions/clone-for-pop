The Clone bound for the pop method is required because we cannot move
elements of the slice out from behind a mutable reference as is stored
in a StackVec struct. If this bound wasn't included/enforced by the
compiler, moving out of the backing slice could cause issues if it is
used for more purposes than just a StackVec.
